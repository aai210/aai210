# Hi, I'm Andrey 👋
I'm a designer who tried his hand at different areas of design to find what suits me. That is why I have some knowledge from related fields. The main direction in design for me was UI/UX. I'm also passionate about 3D graphics, gamedev, coding, productivity and many others. I'm interesting learning something new and work on awesome projects. Sometimes share something with community GitHub.
